## Introduction

The **Framework16 LED Matrix Manager** is a GUI application designed to simplify the configuration and control of Framework16 LED displays. This tool is offering a straightforward interface and powerful features for displaying cool stuff on the displays.

---

## Features

- **Native GUI using QT:** Built with a modern QT interface for a responsive and robust user experience.
- **Easy Management:** Simplified controls for quick and efficient LED display management.
- **Advanced Presets:** Access and utilize a variety of presets.
- **First Class Linux Support:** Optimized for GNU/Linux environments, ensuring reliable performance on x86-64 systems.

---

## Installation üöÄ

### Prerequisites

- [Nix Package Manager](https://nixos.org/download.html) installed on your system.
- Basic understanding of Git and terminal commands.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FabulousCodingFox/framework16-led-matrix-manager.git
   cd framework16-led-matrix-manager
   ```

2. **Enter the Development Environment:**

   ```bash
   nix develop
   ```

   This command initializes a Nix shell with all the necessary dependencies without affecting your host system.

---

## Running ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

You have two methods to run the program:

- **Download Build Artifact:**  
  Download the pre-built artifact from the repository's releases. This artifact is ready to run on any generic GNU/Linux x86-64 system with QT installed.

- **Use Nix Run:**  
  Launch the application directly using Nix by executing:

  ```bash
  nix run
  ```

  This command will build (if necessary) and run the application within the Nix environment.

---

## Development üõ†Ô∏è

To contribute or experiment with new features, start by entering the development environment:

```bash
nix develop
```

This isolated shell ensures that all dependencies are managed appropriately, allowing for a consistent development experience without modifying your main system environment.

---

## Building üì¶

Below are the build instructions for different platforms:

### Linux

For GNU/Linux x86-64 systems, compile the package with:

```bash
nix build .#packages.x86_64-linux.default
```

### Windows

**Note:** The Windows build process is not supported at this time due to limitations with cross-compilation in `nixpkgs.qt6`. If cross-compilation becomes available in future updates, the following command may be applicable:

```bash
nix build .#packages.x86_64-windows.default
```
